			<p>Trail Guides is a micro-site built into the Google Destinations framework, via Google rich search results, that helps bring awareness to national parks, as well as create brand awareness for National Park Service (NPS).</p>
			<p>This project is based on Hawai'i Volcanoes National Park, built into Google's search results, and influenced by a previous collaboration between National Park Service (NPS) and Google. For this project, we solely focused on national parks.</p>
			
			<h3>Contributions</h3>
			<p>My primary role for this project was to create the project pitch video, in which I assembled the video proposal and produced the voiceover. My secondary role focused on user research and research surrounding the current content available through National Park Service, Google Maps, and Google Arts &amp; Culture. I also played a role in maintaining the presentation assets: imagery, video, content, and organizational flow, to ensure the proposal was supported by strong evidence and was easy to follow.</p>

			<h2>RESEARCH</h2>
			
			<h3>Business Problem</h3>
			<p>National Park Service is an agency under the United States federal government, tasked with managing all the national parks, historical monuments and properties of the country. However, parks have seen a decline in visitation by 20% (per capita) since 1987 (their highest visitation year) and has been decreasing since. National Park Service is also having trouble reaching younger and more diverse audiences.</p>

			<h3>Insights</h3>
			<p>How can we help National Park Service achieve preservation and conservation? How might we instill a sense of responsibility and desire in visitors to safeguard national parks? How might we resurface connection in a way that is unique and meaningful to each visitor?</p>
			
			<h3>Challenge</h3>
			<p>The majority of the people who go to the parks are the elderly. So the challenge is that, with technology threatening to monopolize younger audiences, as they are spending more time indoors in front of screens, it is becoming increasingly difficult to foster a conservation ethic.</p>
			
			<h3>Brand Research</h3>
			<p>National Park Service's (NPS) mission is to protect America's natural and cultural resources to ensure it can be passed onto future generations, while providing opportunities for public use and enjoyment. We see NPS's most important values as "guardian of natural and historical resources", "advocate for conservation", and "educator of heritage and legacy". But we chose to specifically focus on the idea of guardianship, where we saw an opportunity to instill the idea into park visitors.</p>
			<p>We wanted to expand on the idea of guardianship by encouraging visitors to adopt this idea as their own, to help protect and preserve national parks for themselves, and for others. With hundreds to thousands of visitors daily, it is becoming too much for NPS staff to maintain by themselves.</p>
			
			<h3>User Research</h3>
			<p>We developed a set of goals as a means to achieve preservation and conservation. However, we realized that, before a person becomes a supporter of parks, they must first become aware of national parks. We spoke to people with a range of hiking experiences, from rarely hiking to hiking often. From our Canadian context, not many had been to many national parks, if at all. Others had no idea whether they had actually been to a national park or not. With this, we asked questions surrounding searching and preparing for trips and how they perceived the NPS brand. Our initial research brought back questions that prompted us to consider whether some of our early concepts were trivial.</p>
			<p>So rather than designing for conservation, which was the highest goal, we chose the low-on-the-tree goal of “increasing recognition of national parks”, that is, focusing on aiding in searching and preparing for parks, with the biggest barrier coming down to clarity and awareness. National parks are a lot more than just another outdoor location; they are a symbol of America’s heritage. So while our solution doesn’t directly solve for increase in visitation, it provides more of an opportunity for it to happen through brand recognition.</p>

			<h2>PROPOSAL</h2>
			
			<h3>Opportunity</h3>
			<p>National Park Service understands that although technology is the reason many young people are spending more and more time indoors, a digital intervention can offer an opportunity to increase recognition and consideration around parks and services, and strengthen their connection to that younger demographic.</p>
			
			<h3>Concept</h3>
			<p>Through our Sprint process, we took three strands of insights: (1) park experience, (2) shared ownership, and (3) sense of responsibility, and developed them into ideas that would drive our concept. Some insights that stood out were implemented into the micro-site, such as "heirlooms" that became the "gems" that could hold a special place in visitors' memory. This concept relied on making someone feel connected to the park, that would gradually manifest into a personal reason for caring.</p>
			<img src="img/nps_conceptdev.png" alt="Concept development">
			
			<h3>Area of Intervention</h3>
			<p>We battled with a strange paradox while finding our area of intervention and developing our concept: trails are eroding from the vast number of visitors daily and vegetation is suffering due to people going off trail. But at the same time, we want to increase brand recognition and national park awareness. We realized we were aiming too high, i.e. we cannot force conservation. Instead, we tackled a low on the tree problem. We believe that by first increasing recognition to national parks, it can lead to conservation efforts as a long-term goal.</p>
			<img src="img/nps_opportunity.png" alt="Research Patterns & Opportunity">
			
			<h3>Journey Framework</h3>
			<p>Once we decided on our area of intervention, our journey framework dove deep into the specifics of the micro-moment, when users transition from learning about a national park, to planning to go to one. We backed up our reasoning for choosing our intervention during the entice stage of a user's interactions with the brand by specifying the frictions and perceived value. It was important to understand our users' thoughts during this moment because it would either move them along the journey to planning their park visit, or become the moment they left the brand.</p>

			<h3>Audience</h3>
			<p>Based on our research, NPS' current audience is mostly comprised of older and white individuals. Though we did find vlogs on YouTube where younger people showcase their park experience and encourage others to visit national parks as well, it seems that NPS is not reaching a wider young demographic. We see this is important because the future of national parks is reliant on this younger audience.</p>
			
			<h3>Persona</h3>
			<p>Our target persona, whom we call "the hopeful explorer", is a younger individual who enjoys the outdoors and is open to going on new adventures, but is unaware of national parks. We initially began with three personas when considering what kinds of users could use our micro-site, with the other two being "the weekend warrior" who actively tries to go on a hike every week, and "the urban dweller" who rarely goes outdoors. We chose our secondary persona (in between the two aforementioned) as our ideal persona because we could best apply our ideas to create awareness and a connection to this type of user.</p>

			<h3>Benefits to Businesses and Users</h3>
			<p>We saw that there were benefits in NPS and Google's past partnership and wanted to extend this relationship to service the park exploration experience. Our research found that NPS and other websites affiliated with it were all quite text heavy, so we situated our solution on Google, where our intended audience would typically start with a new search. This would allow National Park Service to increase their brand recognition and reach more young visitors online. We wanted to highlight that this collaboration would further benefit Google as well, by strengthening their travel ecosystem and growing their off-the-road trail experience on Google Maps. As for the user, they are given the ability to make quicker, more informed decisions through glimpses of a park experience guided by a park ranger.</p>

		<div class="design">
			<h3>Design Choices</h3>
			<p>We originally considered creating a solution on the National Park Service website, but found that our solution would only create more of a redundancy in their already info-dense platform. So we begin with Google “search”, as a natural way to meet our audience where they’re organically going to be, as they begin to look into a park. With the park ranger, we found that people really wanted to get a sense of what actual people who have been to the park were saying about it. The added benefit of having an expert on the subject seemed to really speak to more novice trail-goers, as they wanted to know what they were taking in was credible.</p>
			
			<h3>Immersive Interactions</h3>
			<p>Videos of the trails give a sense of what the terrain will be like, and what the location will look like. We also created “gems”, as points that move users through a trail. This was through research in which people stated key viewpoints were the main reasons they would choose one trail or another. Gems gives people an idea of those viewpoints, without the cognitive overhead of navigating the pages of information that exists on current National Park Service site. This helps build anticipation for users who move from wanting to know about a park, to wanting to go to one.</p>
			
			<h3>Sharing</h3>
			<p>Trail Guides also off-loads onto Google Trips’ existing platform. Since most people that go to national parks don’t go alone, we wanted to give users the ability to share their discoveries with the people they would potentially go with. This way, they are able to save it for later, when they were more seriously considering going and really getting down to planning. This also allows for offline access to the information, if the park they are at doesn’t have Internet connection, which is true for most national parks.</p>

			<h2>THE PROJECT</h2>
			
			<h3>Pitch</h3>
			<p>In partnership with National Park Service and Google, Trail Guides gives potential park visitors an on-the-ground perspective through national parks. Guided by park rangers, this will both intrigue and prepare visitors for their own trip, aiding in the micro-moment of wanting to know about a park, to wanting to go to a park.</p>
			
			<!-- Rich Search -->
			<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/296690139" alt="https://vimeo.com/296690139" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>
			<p><strong>Rich Search:</strong> The rich search result entices users with an interesting image of a location on the trail, but also provides a sense of orientation by giving a small preview of the trail via maps.</p>
			
			<!-- On-The-Ground -->
			<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/296690150" alt="https://vimeo.com/296690150" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>
			<p><strong>On-The-Ground:</strong> Users are introduced to their park ranger, to give a first hand perspective of the park. The on-the-ground perspective gives users a sense of what the trail would be like, such as terrain conditions, and how to prepare. This includes packing suggestions and videos of the trails. Gems (key viewpoints) are the points that move users through the trail.</p>
			
			<!-- Save Trips -->

			<p><strong>Save Trips:</strong> Trail Guides then off-loads onto Google Trip's existing platform, where users are able to access all their information offline.</p>

			<h3>Longevity Plan</h3>
			<p>With 58 national parks under NPS, and even more including forests, reserves, and monuments, there is so much potential for Google Destinations and NPS to expand their networks to help bring awareness to these natural lands. These locations already bring in millions of visitors every year, from all over the world; imagine what a positive impact a strong connection to the brand could make.</p>

			<h2>END THOUGHTS</h2>
			<p class="end">National Park Service's efforts in perserving America's national landmarks is a demonstration of good people wanting to do good things. When beginning our research into the client, that became our long term goal through brand awareness. We found that this "high on the tree" goal would be far from reachable for our design. It became impossible to design for preservation, but with the most we could do being designing for awareness. If I were to continue working on this project, I would continue designing the UI of the product, which I think could stray a bit away from Google Map's brand identity, and more towards a new look for National Park Service. In the long haul, it would mean reimagining the visual branding for NPS as well, because of how scattered the current brand is across multiple sites. I would love to continue tweaking Trail Guides to incorporate more perservation-forward thinking, but I admit it would be a difficult task to take on. Thank you to Kristy Leung, Nikki An, Brandon Lal, and Mark Strathern for collaborating on this project.</p>
