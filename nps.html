			<h1>Trail Guides: <br> Google Destinations x National Park Service</h1>
			<h2>A Google Micro-Site</h2>
			<p>Trail Guides is a micro-site built into the Google Destinations framework, via Google rich search results, that helps create brand awareness, as well as bring awareness to national parks.</p>
			<p>This project is based on Hawai'i Volcanoes National Park, built into Google's search results, and influenced by a previous collaboration between National Park Service (NPS) and Google.</p>

			<b>Roles:</b> Concept Development, User research, User Testing, Videography<br>
			<b>Type:</b> Academic Case Study</p>

			<h3>Business Problem</h3>
			<p>National Park Service is an agency under the federal government of the United States, tasked with managing all the national parks, reserves, and monuments of the country. However, parks have seen a decline in visitation by 20% (per capita) since 1987 (their highest visitation year) and has been decreasing since. National Park Service is also having trouble reaching younger and more diverse audiences.</p>

			<h3>Research</h3>
			<h4>Brand</h4>
			<p>National Park Service's (NPS) mission is to protect America's natural and cultural resources to ensure it can be passed onto future generations, while providing opportunities for public use and enjoyment. We see National Park Service's most important values as "guardian of natural and historical resources", "advocate for conservation", and "educator of heritage and legacy". But we chose to specifically focus on the idea of guardianship, where we saw an opportunity to instill the idea into park visitors.</p>
			<div class="centred">
				<img class="img-middle" src="img/nps_values.png" alt="Guiding Values">
			</div>
			<p>We wanted to expand on the idea of guardianship by encouraging visitors to adopt this idea as their own, to help protect and preserve national parks for themselves, and for others. With hundreds to thousands of visitors daily, it is becoming too much for National Park Service staff to maintain by themselves.</p>
			<h4>User Research</h4>
			<p>We spoke to people with a range of hiking experience, from rarely hiking to hiking often. In our Canadian context, not many had been to many national parks, if at all. With this, we asked questions surrounding searching and preparing for trips and how they perceived the National Park Service brand. Our initial research brought back questions that prompted us to consider whether some of our early concepts were trivial. Through multiple iterations and interviews, we reached our decision to focus on aiding in searching and preparing for parks, with the biggest barrier coming down to clarity and awareness.</p>
			<div class="centred">
				<img class="img-middle" src="img/nps_opportunity.png" alt="Research Patterns & Opportunity">
			</div>
			
			<h3>Proposal</h3>
			<p>Trail Guides gives potential park visitors <sec class="highlight">an on-the-ground perspective</sec> of national parks, guided by National Park Service (NPS) Rangers, that both intrigues and prepares them for their own trip. This will aid in <sec class="highlight">the micro-moment of wanting to know about a park, to wanting to go to a park</sec>.</p>
			<h4>Audience</h4>
			<p>Based on our research, NPS' current audience is mostly comprised of older and white individuals. Though we did find vlogs on YouTube where younger people showcase their park experience and encourage others to visit national parks as well, it seems that NPS is not reaching a wider young demographic. We see this is important because the future of national parks is reliant on this younger audience.</p>
			<h4>Area of Intervention</h4>
			<p>We battled with a strange paradox while finding our area of intervention and developing our concept: trails are eroding from the vast number of visitors daily and vegetation is suffering due to people going off trail. However, we also want to increase brand recognition and national parks awareness. We realized we were aiming too high, i.e. we cannot force conservation. Instead, we tackled a low on the tree problem. We believe that by first increasing recognition to national parks, it can lead to conservation efforts.</p>
			<div class="centred">
				<img class="img-middle" src="img/nps_lowgoal.png" alt="Low on the Tree Goal">
			</div>
			<p>We saw benefit in NPS and Google's past partnership and wanted to extend this relationship to service the park exploration experience. Our research found that NPS and it's affiliate websites were already text heavy, so we situated our solution on Google, where our intended audience typically starts with a new search. We also wanted to highlight that Google would benefit in this collaboration as well, by strengthening their travel ecosystem and growing their off-the-road trail experience on Maps.</p>
			<div class="centred">

			</div>
			<h4>Concept</h4>
			<p>Through our Sprint process, we took three strands of insights, <sec class="highlight">park experience, shared ownership, and sense of responsibility</sec>, and developed them into ideas that would drive our concept. Some insights that stood out were implemented into the micro-site, such as "heirloom" that became the gems of trails that could hold a special place in a visitor's memory. This concept really relied on making someone feel connected to the park, that would gradually manifest into a personal reason for caring.</p>

			<h3>Persona</h3>
			<p>Our target persona, as we call "hopeful explorer", is a younger individual who enjoys the outdoors, and is open to going on new adventures, but is unaware of national parks. We actually began with 3 personas when considering what kinds of users could use our micro-site, with the other two being the "weekend warrior" who actively tries to go on a hike every week, and the "urban dweller" who rarely goes outdoors. We chose our secondary persona (in between the two aforementioned) as our ideal persona because we could best apply our ideas to create awareness and a connection to this type of user.</p>

			<h3>Journey Framework</h3>
			<div class="centred">
				<img class="img-middle" src="img/nps_journeyframework.png" alt="Journey Framework">
			</div>
			<p>Once we figured out where our area of intervention would be, our journey framework dove deep into the specificities of the micro-moment, when users go from learning about a national park, to planning to go to one. We backed up our reasoning for choosing to place our intervention during the entice stage of a user's interactions with the brand by specifying the frictions and perceived value. It was important for us to understand our user's thoughts during this moment because it would either move them along the journey to planning their park visit, or this would be the moment they left the brand.</p>

			<h4>Longevity Plan</h4>

			<p class="end">With 58 National Parks under NPS, and even more including forests, reserves, and monuments, there is so much potential for Google Destinations and NPS to expand their networks to help bring awareness to these natural lands. So many people already visit national parks from all over the world. Imagine what a positive impact a strong connection to the brand could make.</p>
