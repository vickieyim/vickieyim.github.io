                    <p>Reap is a growing payment technology platform that aims to help small and medium-sized businesses unlock cash flow to accelerate their success. Reap can help simplify business payments, whether cross-border or local, and provide instant credit to pay rents, salaries, invoices, taxes, vendors, and more, while using their preferred credit card to collect rewards like cash back and Air Miles.</p>

            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p>As a startup, Reap is continually aiming to attract and gain the trust of new users. The platform was originally built for functionality over visual design, and was outdated in terms of usability, responsiveness, branding, and industry standards, resulting in poor impressions, user frustrations, and drop-offs.</p>

            <h2>Functional Testing for QA</h2>
            <p>With the product and engineering teams, I provided quality assurance tests to ensure our product met usability standards without errors or difficulties.</p>

            <h2>The Final Designs</h2>

            <div class="subsection">
                <h3 class="subheader">Improving branding and accessibility</h3>
                <p>In redesigning the Reap platform, my goals included creating a brand guideline/design system, improving usability, meeting accessibility standards, and creating a responsive site. I researched Reap’s competitors and other business within the industry to learn what our users were expecting from us, and conducted qualitative research to find what pains and frustrations our users were experiencing.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="subsection">
                <h3>Building trust through communication</h3>
                <p>Based on our analytical data, the majority of users who signed up for a Reap account would not go through the process of making a payment (collecting payments was in development at the time). From this, we inferred that our users wanted to know how Reap worked, stopping just before entering their personal financial information. This lead to the development of the Reap Guide, a comprehensive onboarding guide that details how Reap can be used, and explains the security measures we take to keep user information safe.</p>

            <div class="subsection">
                <h3>Adopting best practices of form design</h3>
                <p>To better organize the multi-screen payment form, I utilized best practices including simplifying with conditional fields (different fields are required for different beneficiaries types), in-line validation, field focus (while scrolling, i.e. keyboard doesn’t cover input field), and logically grouped fields.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>My Takeaways</h2>
            <p>I think the form fields design was done relatively well at the time, but now that I reflect on it, there are still details that could have been added on different pages to remove memory burdens, and provide important information earlier. It was my first time building a design system, so it was a bit simpler as I was learning how to build a proper one, but there was a lot more I could have done, and I didn’t get a chance to build it up as we were building out more product offerings. In addition to the design system, I also would want to update the UI to create better hierarchy by adding more depth and elevation to the designs.</p>
